# Service Design
## :pencil2: Problem Statement
Problems Faced by Students, Club Initiators, and Club Leaders:
1) Students Creating Clubs
i. Need for Centralized Source of Information: Having access to a centralized source of comprehensive and up-to-date information about existing clubs and their activities would enable students to save time and effort in determining and creating their niche within the SAS community.
2) Students Applying to Clubs
i. Need for Centralized Source of Information: Students interested in joining clubs encounter challenges obtaining accurate, updated information about club offerings, meeting times, and past activities.
ii. Unreliable Sources: Relying on word of mouth for club information often results in outdated or inaccurate details, leading to confusion and misinformed decisions.
3) Student Club Leaders
i. Manual Administrative Processes: Club leaders responsible for overseeing clubs will be able to optimize their management of club-related administrative tasks, such as updating club information or helping officers disseminate announcements.
